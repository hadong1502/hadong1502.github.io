Hi there! Welcome to my personal website, where I write about the world under the lens of an aspiring student of Science. 

**A few details about myself**: I am a rising senior triple-majoring in Neuroscience, Mathematics, and Physics at Amherst College. I spent a few summers working as a full-time research assistant at the [Meiler Lab at Vanderbilt](https://meilerlab.org/), the [Meister Lab at Caltech](https://meisterlab.caltech.edu/), and the [Murthy Lab at Harvard](https://vnmurthylab.org/), diving into questions of artificial and biological intelligence. During the school year, I spend most of my time at the [Trapani Lab](https://www.trapanilab.com/) where I study the neural encoding of the startle responses in Zebrafish. Some of my published works could be found in the *Publications* page. 

I love learning (I know, such a nerd, right?) and often easily get excited about anything that seems cool. Beyond the bench, I’m passionate about religious studies and documentary filmmaking. Feel free to check out my latest [project](https://www.valleysoundscapes.org/sounds-of-faith-a-story-of-quranic-reciters-in-the-connecticut-river-valley-2024/) and reach out if you’d like to collaborate. 

When I'm free, I enjoy making [lemon tonic coldbrew](https://dukesandduchesses.com/lemon-cold-brew-tonic-recipe/) (make sure you add a few grains of pink salt to this recipe), pretending to be a movie critic, landscape photography, urban sketching, reading, and playing the cajon. 

I'm a strong believer of DEI and inclusive education. I've been affiliated with the Amherst College's [Strategic Learning Center](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/support/strategic-learning-center/about), the [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/center-teaching-learning/contact-us), and the [Biology Department DEI committee](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/biology/equity-inclusion), where I advocate for accessible learning opportunities in higher education. This journey began with an [initiative](https://vtv.vn/dong-ngoc-ha.html) I launched in Vietnam a few years ago to teach Biology to students across the country for free. If you’d like to learn more, the Vanguard News (Báo Tiền Phong) published a very flattering article [very flattering article](https://tienphong.vn/nguoi-truyen-cam-hung-hoc-mon-sinh-hoc-post1417042.tpo) about my work.
